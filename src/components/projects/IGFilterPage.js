                    (Instagram and Facebook's augmented reality software), I
                    recently learned that filters could be made for both

                    and I decided to make my own.

                    Although convenience stores are commonplace in South Korea
                    and a few large companies dominate the market. Whether it's
                    GS25, CU, EMART24, or even MiniStop‚Äîeach brand is a bit
                    different and has a different feel. I decided that would be
                    the concept for the filter.

                    When the user tabs the screen, the program shuffles through

                    stops on a randomized selection to display.

                    user presses the screen in the middle of a quiz the program
                    can know to ignore that interaction. When the quiz is
                    complete, the status is changed to{' '}
                    <span className="black">"finished"</span> and a user can tap
                    the screen again to restart the quiz.

                    This was my first attempt using any kind of augmented
                    reality software and it was a lot of fun. The program and
                    the filter are both relatively simple, but it was enjoyable
                    to make something that interacted with a user in a 3D
                    environment. This kind of interaction is something I hope to
                    explore more in the future.
