                    . It‚Äôs the most popular social media platform among all the
                    runners I‚Äôve ever met. I just finished a project that used a
                    public Web API and I was excited to find that Strava has its
                    own. The documentation looked great and I knew I wanted to
                    create something with it.

                    <br />
                    One thing I know is that runners love data. It‚Äôs the reason
                    that Strava exists! Endurance athletes love to see their
                    activities broken down into pace, splits, heart rate,
                    calories, VO2 Max, etc. This is the central idea behind the
                    project. Users have done all this work, let‚Äôs show them how
                    it all adds up!

                <p className="project-description">
                    Strava is distinctly orange. It‚Äôs one of their defining
                    characteristics and something I wanted to incorporate into
                    this project. I didn‚Äôt want to look like Strava, but I
                    wanted the user to be reminded of where their information
                    was coming from.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Since this project is focused on presenting data, I liked
                    the idea of a simple, somewhat geometric UI. I also choose a
                    shade of indigo to accompany Strava‚Äôs trademark orange,
                    while also giving my project its own feel.

                <h1 className="project-about">State Management ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>
                <p className="project-description">
                    Across the app, I handled state using{' '}
                    <span className="black">a Redux store</span>. I read that
                    smaller projects don‚Äôt always necessitate one, but I wanted
                    to get some practice using the technology.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The first thing I needed to keep track of was what units the
                    user preferred. I also needed to know what sports the user
                    had selected. Below is a short selection from the default
                    state:
                </p>
                <CodeBox image={code1} imageHeight={'80px'} />
                <p className="project-description">
                    To keep it simple, I used a boolean value to toggle between
                    metric and imperial and an array to represent the sports
                    chosen. I used ‚Äòrunning‚Äô as the default so the user would
                    see some data as soon as they logged in and metric because I
                    currently live in South Korea.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Putting <span className="black">totalDistance</span>, which
                    represents the total of all activities the user has
                    selected, into the store also makes it easier to call that
                    value whenever calculations are needed across the app.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Next, I needed to store the user‚Äôs athletic totals based on
                    sports:
                </p>
                <CodeBox image={code2} imageHeight="330px" />
                <p className="project-description">
                    Since data from the Strava API is given in meters, I made a
                    simple function to convert that into kilometers and miles.
                    This way, I would only have to run the conversion
                    calculation once, and then simply toggle the two values.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Next, I set up action creators and reducers for each action.
                    Here‚Äôs an example of a reducer I used to add and remove
                    sports from the user‚Äôs selection.
                    <br />
                    <br />I also set up similar reducers for each action and

                    The Strava API is powerful and well organized, but their
                    JavaScript documentation was a bit hard to follow at times.
                    There are also way fewer projects using it than I expected,
                    and I wasn‚Äôt able to find a tutorial or guide for setting up

                <p className="project-description">
                    For the first draft of the project, I exclusively accessed
                    the Redux store the only way I had been taught, using
                    connect and mapStateToProps every single time I needed
                    something from the store. I thought it was the only way!

                    <br />
                    It wasn‚Äôt until I posted the project online that a few

                    much cleaner, so I went back and refactored everything that
                    accessed the state. It was a bit of a headache to change
                    something that was already working fine, but and I‚Äôm really
