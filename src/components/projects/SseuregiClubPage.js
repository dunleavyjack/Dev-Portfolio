                    I wanted to make an application that could help users track

                    about in the city.

                    <br />

                <TextSpacer />
                <h1 className="project-about">The Program üë®‚Äçüî¨</h1>
                <p className="project-description">
                    First, the program finds the user‚Äôs current coordinates
                    using <span className="black">HTML5 GeoLocation</span>. That
                    location is then pinned and a map is created with that point
                    as its center. I also used an animation to create a
                    ‚Äòzoom-in‚Äô effect from a larger map of the entire city.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Next, while the map is zooming in, the user‚Äôs distance from
                    each bin (which is stored locally with a{' '}
                    <span className="black">longitude</span> and
                    <span className="black"> latitude</span>) is calculated.
                    This is done by programmatically drawing an invisible line
                    between the two points and then finding the distance of that
                    line.
                </p>
                <CodeBox image={code1} imageHeight={'211px'} />
                <p className="project-description">
                    Then, the program decides if that bin is close enough to the
                    user to flag it as nearby. In this case, the distance is set
                    as a radius of 800m around the user and the total amount of
                    nearby bins is saved using a{' '}
                    <span className="black">useState()</span> hook.
                </p>
                <CodeBox image={code2} imageHeight={'72px'} />
                <p className="project-description">
                    The program also keeps track of whether or not each bin is
                    recycling or trash-only, like so:
                </p>
                <CodeBox image={code3} imageHeight={'188px'} />
                <p className="project-description">
                    Finally, a ‚Äúclick‚Äù event listener is added to each marker
                    that launches an info window about that bin when selected by
                    a user. That window includes that bin's distance from the
                    user, whether or not it is for trash or recycling, and the
                    option to view directions to its location.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Lastly, once every bin is mapped through, the total of
                    nearby bins and the counts for both recycling bins and
                    trash-only bins are passed into a custom{' '}
                    <span className="black">{'<InfoPanel />'}</span> component
                    and displayed in the UI.

                <p className="project-description">
                    One early hurdle for this project was the fact that is no
                    public database for trash and recycling receptacles in
                    Seoul. I spent some time browsing the government‚Äôs websites
                    for the city as well as its different municipal districts,
                    but couldn‚Äôt find anything.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Instead, the data for each bin in the application was
                    collected using a bicycle and a geolocation app. I would
                    find a bin and use the app from my phone to pin the
                    coordinates. Later on, I would add the data to the program
                    on my machine at home.

                    I figured that users of this application would likely not be
                    at their personal computers, so I went with a mobile-first
                    design. Everything is responsive and I tested the program on
                    both desktop and mobile layouts, but I made it with special
                    considerations for mobile users.
                    <br />
                    <br />I also found that I can save a lot of time by
                    designing first using <span className="black">Figma</span>.
                    I still can‚Äôt believe that program is totally free and I use

                    find that the API had pretty good documentation as well as a
                    helpful online community of Korean developers who were also
                    using the API for their own projects.
