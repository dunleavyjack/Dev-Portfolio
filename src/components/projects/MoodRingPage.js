                    I knew I wanted to do a project with the Spotify API. It‚Äôs
                    enormously powerful and provides a wealth of analytics for
                    every song in the entire Spotify library, which is very
                    cool. While reading through their documentation, I got an
                    idea to show the user some data about their recent taste in
                    music. To make it more interesting, I thought it would be
                    fun and personal to show the user an assumption about
                    themselves, somewhat like a horoscope. An extension of that
                    idea, I decided on a mood detector.

                <p className="project-description">
                    The Spotify API provides some really interesting analytics
                    for their songs. In addition to the more expected{' '}
                    <span className="black">tempo</span>,{' '}
                    <span className="black">bpm</span>, and{' '}
                    <span className="black">song key</span>, Spotify also
                    includes <span className="black">danceability</span>,{' '}
                    <span className="black">acousticness</span>,{' '}
                    <span className="black">energy</span>, and{' '}
                    <span className="black">valence</span> (a measure of
                    perceived happiness). As you can see, Spotify has already
                    done a lot of the heavy lifting. On my end, I set average
                    values for each analytic and wrote functions to find and
                    then compare their percent difference to those averages.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If a song was lower than average for, say,{' '}
                    <span className="black">danceability</span>, then I would
                    flag that song as{' '}
                    <span className="black">"less danceable"</span> by a value
                    of its percent difference from average. This way, I could
                    rank them. This gave me an ordered list of which analytics
                    stood out the most from a user‚Äôs recent listening
                    experience. This is where things got fun. If a user‚Äôs recent
                    songs were most notable for having, for example,{' '}
                    <span className="black">"more happiness"</span> and{' '}
                    <span className="black">"more danceability"</span> then I
                    felt it was safe to assume that the user was possibly
                    feeling <span className="black">energetic</span> or
                    <span className="black"> expressive</span>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Here‚Äôs a simple example from the very first mood my program
                    detects:
                </p>
                <CodeBox image={code1} imageHeight={'200px'} />
                <p className="project-description">
                    Here, a user has been listening to songs that have{' '}
                    <span className="black">more happiness</span> (feeling good)
                    but also <span className="black"> lower danceability </span>
                    (feeling calm), so my assumption is that they might be
                    feeling <span className="black">peaceful</span> or{' '}
                    <span className="black">content</span>. That‚Äôs the basis of
                    the algorithm. After that, deciding the other different mood
                    combinations was pretty fun. Choosing the right word was a
                    little like poetry.

                    I originally learned how to do OAuth2 using{' '}

                    authentication tokens during the handoff from Spotify‚Äôs auth
                    page back to the app. This was fine until I learned it was
                    causing problems for users with adblockers.
                    <br />
                    <br />I learned that this method creates a cookie on the
                    browser, which caused the red flag. But luckily there was a
                    simple solution, I implemented a Redux store to hold the
                    tokens instead.

                    profile image to solve the problem. Now, I am more cautious
                    with objects returned from an API.
