                    In South Korea, there is a well-known deal at almost every
                    convenience store known colloquially as the{' '}
                    <span className="black">Four For Ten</span>. The deal is
                    simple, four beers for 10,000 Korean won. But, not every
                    beer is included in the deal (namely the extremely popular
                    domestic beer, Cass) so you need to be careful.

                    make a game using that concept. You play as a character

                    traditional scrolling style while being careful to avoid the

                    gift. So, the user plays as a 2D rendered version of my
                    friend's head.

                    This was the first programming project I was ever able to
                    properly share with others and the whole experience was a
                    lot of fun. These days, I focus more on JavaScript but in
                    the future, I would be interested in using Python again. In
                    the scope of Web Development, I would like to use it for a
                    backend technology like Django. As my first programming
                    language, it's definitely something I hope to use again!
