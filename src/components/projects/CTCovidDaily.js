                    Like a lot of people, when the pandemic first hit I spent a
                    lot of time checking the current cases for my area.
                    Routinely, I would look at the number of new cases, the
                    amount of tests being conducted, and the rising total cases.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Because I was checking so often, the process of opening the
                    government website and navigating to the daily cases was a
                    bit time consuming. I wondered if I could find a more
                    convienent way to display that information and I decided to
                    make an iOS application for that purpose. I no longer live
                    in Connecticut, but my parents do and when checking the
                    COVID numbers there I noticed the local governement had a
                    free, open API for COVID data. I figured that would be a
                    good place to start

                <p className="project-description">
                    This project was my first independent project using Swift,
                    which, unlike Javascript, is a{' '}

                    . It took a little getting used to, but I quickly learned to
                    appreciate the time saving benefits of type declaration.
                    These days I've been learning TypeScript and I've found that
                    my time with Swift created a good foundation.

                <p className="project-description">
                    Connecticut's COVID data API offered a ton of data for total
                    cases, probable cases, and tests completed but they only
                    offered an <span className="black">overal total</span>. In
                    order to find the daily change, which was the concept of
                    this application, I had to request the data for the current
                    date as well as the previous day and then find the
                    difference between the two.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    While these kinds of functions are familiar to me in
                    Javascript, it was a fun challenge to replicate them in a
                    different language. I definitely learned a lot from this
                    project.
