                    Like a lot of people, when the pandemic first hit I spent a
                    lot of time checking the current cases for my area.
                    Routinely, I would look at the number of new cases, the
                    amount of tests being conducted, and the rising total cases.

                <p className="project-description">
                    Because I was checking so often, the process of opening the
                    government website and navigating to the daily cases was a
                    bit time consuming. I wondered if I could find a more
                    convienent way to display the information and I decided to
                    make an iOS application. I no longer live in Connecticut,
                    but my parents do and when checking the COVID numbers there
                    I noticed the local governement had an free, open API for
                    COVID data. I figured that would be a good place to start
                </p>
