                    The goal was to accelerate UI testing, so I wrote different
                    tests for user authentication, the ability to actively trade
                    different cryptocurrencies, in addition to various other
                    actions across the site.

                    I've been using Cypress to test my personal projects for a
                    while now and this was great opportunity to use that skill
                    in a professional setting.

                    In the future, I would like to get more familiar with
                    additional testing frameworks (like Jest) as well.
